Flappy Sausage

MVP - an object that moves up and down on the y-axis on click (spacebar?). Collision detection. Objects moving from right to left towards it.

Y-axis falling should act like gravity - increasing speed the longer it falls.
Start to rise on mouse click/mousedown?
Use setInterval every ms/every 10ms to refresh y-axis position.



Tuesday Plan

Refactor - go over game code, break up into more functions. Remove hard-coding in obstacle/sausage positioning - look at CSS too, scaleable?

Introduce dynamic difficulty? Game speeds up the longer you play.
Add menu - whole game playable with keyboard. Bind certain keys.
Introduce difficulty modifier?

Other possibilities - popups for bonus points, popups for short-term score multipliers.

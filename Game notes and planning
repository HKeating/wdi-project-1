Flappy Sausage

MVP - an object that moves up and down on the y-axis on click (spacebar?). Collision detection. Objects moving from right to left towards it.

Y-axis falling should act like gravity - increasing speed the longer it falls.
Start to rise on mouse click/mousedown?
Use setInterval every ms/every 10ms to refresh y-axis position.



Tuesday Plan

Refactor - go over game code, break up into more functions. Remove hard-coding in obstacle/sausage positioning - look at CSS too, scaleable?

Introduce dynamic difficulty? Game speeds up the longer you play.
Add menu - whole game playable with keyboard. Bind certain keys.
Introduce difficulty modifier?

Other possibilities - popups for bonus points, popups for short-term score multipliers.



Tuesday Evening new plan

Style
- find background image, look in to slow-scroll. How to avoid removing it when using $board.empty()? - 'Animate' sausage. Decide whether to use sausage or not...
- style the obstacles
- spikes, or something along bottom of screen?
- fonts
- colour scheme
- borders, page resizing?

Functionality
- animations for gameover, hitting bonus, others?
- event listener for tapping
- difficulty selector at start (sets a global variable to modify rate at which game speed increases and points are accrued (and value of bonuses?))
- highscore table: array (or object? (or array of objects??)) to store top 5(+?) scores in current play session. make it harder to clear highscores (put a confirm on the -r- event)
- sounds... music? on jump, on bonus, on death
- improved menus (selector that can be moved with arrow keys, and/or dual functionality with click/keymapping)

  - menu flow:
        landing page (name of game. some animation? 'press any key to continue')
          => starting menu with instructions options to start game, select difficulty, or view high scores (+ mute button?)
            => difficulty select: three(?) options, which sets global difficulty multiplier
            => play game
            => view high scores, no results initially (or set of placeholders at steady intervals?)
              => game over screen, list score, tell you if you got a highscore (ask for name if so), options return to main menu or view high scores
                => view high scores
                => return to main menu

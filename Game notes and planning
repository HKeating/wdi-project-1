Flappy Sausage

MVP - an object that moves up and down on the y-axis on click (spacebar?). Collision detection. Objects moving from right to left towards it.

Y-axis falling should act like gravity - increasing speed the longer it falls.
Start to rise on mouse click/mousedown?
Use setInterval every ms/every 10ms to refresh y-axis position.
